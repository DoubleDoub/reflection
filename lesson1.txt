# Reflections on Lesson 1


**How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?**

I am using linux so, my output was kind of different and it was a litter harder to find the bug.... But still much and much easier then it would haven been if I did it the manual hard way.

**How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?**

I can switch between versions with a few key strokes. If bugs were introduced I can just switch to older version. And find the bug in another branch. Finding the bug will also be much easier because I will now where to look for it. 


**What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?**

**Pro**
*- You can add logical order to commits. Making your git log less gluttered and meaningfull. 
*- thus makes it easier to find newly created bugs
*- thus makes it easier to revert to an older version without having to far back.

**Conn**
-You can forget to commit


**Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?**

People using git need to have changes related to one another tracked. People using Google Docs do not. I also think it is much harder to implement. 

**How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?**

git log gives you an overview of all committed changes in your git tracked project.
git diff can show you what lines have changed between 2 different commits.

**How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?**

Because it is now much easier to track down my mistakes and buggs. 

**Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?**

For my next homework assignment. After that for everything that is coding related
